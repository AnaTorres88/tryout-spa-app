# Tryout entry 
 Hi, first of all, thank you for this opportunity, this is my entry for the tryouts. I added the requested functionality, plus a little extra.
 
 I created a simple node.js backend to showcase my backend skills.
 ## Features requested
  #### Users module
    - User details when accesing url
    - Delete user
 #### News module
    - News detail
 #### Language change

## Instructions
1. Download both app and backend
2. install modules by writing ``` npm install``` in the terminal
3. run both projects at once

## Thought process an other features
    - Since the design wasn't specified I took some agency and inspected the Company's website, I took note of the colors that integrate the palette as well as the fonts and the general layout of the website.
    - One of those fonts is paid, so I added a different one in handwritten style instead.
    - I installed Bootstrap and a css preprocessor to showcase those skills.
    - I picked Bootstrap for accesibility compliance and i18next to implement translation.
    - Accessing details of the chosen user requires a router.
    - Added loaders to routes.
    - I set up a basic node.js backend
    
 ## Room for improvement
 There is always room for improvement and this project is not the exception. Unfortunately I didn't have enought time to set up a proper database, in fact I'll take some liberties and suggest the following updates that may improve this project:
    - Authentication.
    - Filters for User tables and pagination.
    - Batch delete for user table.
    - Toasters and other alerts for actions such as deletion of a user from the table.
    - Unit testing.
